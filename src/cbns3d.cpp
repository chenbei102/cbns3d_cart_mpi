/**
 * @brief High-Order 3D Compressible Navier-Stokes Solver
 *
 * This program implements a high-order finite difference solver for the 
 * 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations on a Cartesian grid. 
 * It supports parallel execution using MPI, enabling efficient utilization 
 * of multiple cores or processors for large-scale computations.
 *
 * This file contains the main function, which serves as the application
 * entry point.
